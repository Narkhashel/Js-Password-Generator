# Js-Password-Generator

## Description

This time around, we had to create a random password generator. We were provided with HTML and CSS code already, and a basic frame of how our JavaScript code can look like.

It presented a lot of small challenges, and when some of the pieces were relatively easy to tackle others presented real headaches for me, overall when I had a general idea of how it all was supposed to look I did struggle the most with implementing it all properly. But it finally works!! Let me prove it to you.

### Acceptance Criteria

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password
      * At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  * Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Credits

On this particular challenge, I collaborated with the whole group of students and shared some ideas with a few more. Most of the code was created together with Tomasz Jasinski, my colleague from a boot camp. Using various resources, we wrote the bulk of the code, solving multiple problems along the way.
